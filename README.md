# Front-End Developer's Test (psd-html conversion)

The main goal of this test is to demonstrate your front-end skills (html, css and javascript).


## Developer Test

- The main goal is to convert (as best as possible) provided psd's file design into HTML (.psd to html/css conversion) page.

- Layout should try to match the provided wireframes or at least table/grid/form elements from the provided wireframes (from [UI/UX Desing](#ui-ux-desing) section below)


### Development Process

When doing your test you have 2 options:

1. Downloading the repo locally and submitting the solution as a .zip file back to us.

2. Following collaborative development model (github's way) of forking the test repo, implementing your solution and than creating a pull-request back to the main repo. This way might give us some insight in your git capabilities and therefor is considered to be a prefered way.


### Technologies

The technologies to be used while doing the test are:

1. [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - as a base for your UI

Extra points go for using some of the following:

1. [Less](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/#less) - as a CSS preprocessor to be used for your custom stylings

2. [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - as a task runner for things like preprocessing less to css, js hinting, building production ready assets..


### UI/UX Desing

The **designs/y-Ois-light-03.psd** file contains the design specification that should ideally be used as a reference for the UI components stylings for your test. 

When doing your test you could at least try to replicate certain components from the design document (**designs/y-Ois-light-03.psd**) like tables, grid or form styings. Ideally we are looking forward to the entire design conversion, but due to time constraints, replicating at least some of the things we listed might give as enough insigths of your psd to html/css conversion capabilities.
